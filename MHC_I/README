Hi, this is the default benchmark for the MHC-I peptide binding 
prediction challenge.



#################
# TRAINING DATA #
#################

The training data for this benchmark is the same we used for the
NNAlign_MA publication (https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.TIR119.001658).

Up to this day there are two main types of data for MHC-I:

    1) Binding Affinity (BA) 
       ¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨
       This data has real-valued target values in the range [0,1].
       Training partitions for this data type can be found in the 
       "ba_data" folder.

    2) Eluted Ligands (EL)
       ¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨
       This data has binary target values.
       Training partitions for this data type can be found in the 
       "el_data" folder.


Depending on your model, you can use these types of data combined
or separatedly to train.

NOTE: Multi-Allelic (MA) data labels of the EL portion of the data
were replaced with the top-scoring MHC-I prediction (this is, the 
assigned MHC-I allele) of NNAlign_MA. To see the commands employed
to do this, refer to the "scripts/MA_to_SA" folder, "do_work" script.



#########################
# INDEPENDENT TEST DATA #
#########################

This is, as well, the employed test data for the NNAlign_MA 
paper. The full dataset consists of 558 individual sets, each one 
corresponding to an epitope (associated with a target value of 1) 
and all the 8 to 14 mer overlapping peptides of the epitope's source 
protein (associated with a target value of 0). All these test
sets were selected such that they do not overlap with the training 
set, guaranteeing an independent testing.

The test datasets can be found in the "test_sets" 
folder. Information regarding these testsets can be found 
in the "test_sets_info" file. The script used to generate 
all these files can be found in the "scripts/epitopes" folder, as 
"do_work".
