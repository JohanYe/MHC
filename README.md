# MHC Encoding
Special course with Morten Nielsen

Experiments are based on [DeepLigand](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593).
Extensive experiments were performed as to residual network structure and LSTM structure. Other conclusions are drawn of minor and more superficial experiments. <br>
<b> Conclusions drawn </b>:
* 5-layer residual network of 'cabd' structure performs the best
* Evaluating residual network outputs in a Gaussian distribution hurts overall performance. 
* Using a fully LSTM structure helps the LSTM. 
* ReZero initialization is not helpful
* Learning rate scheduler does not help (superficial experiments only)

### Best model results

Model | AUC | PCC
--- | --- | ---
Residual Network | 0.927 | 0.803
Ensemble of Residual Network | 0.931 | 0.812

With the ensembl network outperforming [NetMHCPan 3.0](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-016-0288-x)
